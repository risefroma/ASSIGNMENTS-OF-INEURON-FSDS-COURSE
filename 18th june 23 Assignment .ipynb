    "Logging in Python is the process of recording messages that track the execution of a program. These messages can be used for debugging, monitoring, and understanding the behavior of an application. Python provides a built-in module named logging to facilitate logging.\n",
    "Importance of Logging in Software Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging: Logging provides insights into the flow of the program and the values of variables at different points in time. This helps developers identify and fix bugs more efficiently than using print statements\n",

    "Monitoring: Logging enables continuous monitoring of an application in production. It helps in keeping track of the application's performance, detecting anomalies, and identifying potential issues before they become critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audit Trail: Logging provides a historical record of events that have occurred within an application. This is useful for auditing purposes, where you need to know who did what and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Reporting: When an error occurs, logging can capture the context and details of the error, making it easier to diagnose and resolve the issue. This is especially valuable for remote or unattended applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security: Logging can help detect and respond to security incidents by recording unauthorized access attempts, unusual activities, and other security-related events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the different log levels in increasing order of severity:\n",
    "\n",
    "DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",

    "INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",

    "9. what is the difference between the logging and print statements in Python?\n",
    "When should you use logging over print statements in a real-world application\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "Print: Used for simple output to the console. It is primarily meant for displaying information to the user during development or for simple debugging purposes.\n",
    "Logging: Designed for recording events that happen during the execution of a program. It is intended for tracking and debugging complex applications in a structured manner.\n",
    "Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Print: Limited to outputting messages to the console.\n",
    "Logging: Highly configurable. You can direct log messages to different destinations (console, files, remote servers, etc.), and filter messages based on severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).\n",
    "Severity Levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "Print: All messages are treated equally.\n",
    "Logging: Messages can be categorized by severity levels, making it easier to filter and handle different kinds of events appropriately.\n",
    "Configurability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Print: No built-in support for message formatting or customization.\n",
    "Logging: Supports advanced configuration including formatting of messages, adding contextual information, and defining handlers for different output streams.\n",
    "Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Print: Can be less efficient for high-frequency logging because it always outputs to the console, which can slow down the program.\n",
    "Logging: More efficient and can be configured to minimize performance impact, such as by batching log messages or adjusting the logging level\n",

    "**When to Use Logging Over Print**\n",
    "**Production Applications:**\n",
    "Use logging in production applications to record events, errors, and other significant occurrences. It helps in monitoring the application and diagnosing issues after deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debugging:**\n",
    "While print can be used for quick debugging, logging provides more context and control over the output, making it more useful for debugging complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability:**\n",
    "In large or distributed applications, logging allows you to collect and aggregate logs from multiple sources, making it easier to manage and analyze logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintaining Code:**\n",
    "logging makes it easier to manage and maintain code by providing a standardized way of outputting diagnostic information, which can be enabled or disabled as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compliance and Auditing:**\n",
    "Many applications require maintaining logs for compliance and auditing purposes. The logging module provides the necessary features to meet these requirements.\n",
